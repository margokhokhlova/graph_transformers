    "In this approach the authours were inspired by the paragraph2vec method of paragrahps embeddings. The algorithm creates sub-graph embeddings which take neighborhood or structural information (separately) into account. The neighborhood information is similar to node2vec (i.e an node ID), the structural infromation of each node is represented as a ratio of node degree to the size of  a subgraph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on random walks, where the graph-paths track how the density of edges changes in a neighbourhood. The nodes are coded (depending on their degree/graph size ratio - structural, on their id - neighborhood) into a log scale vocabulary. To learn the final embeddings, researchers propose two methods exising in word3vec model: sub2vec-DM (predicting neigh node and graph) and sud2vec-DBON (co-occurence based learning). Negative samling is used as in word2vec. The idea of the method is the following - graphs which have common nodes should have similar embeddings.\n",

    "The edge histogram kernel is a basic linear kernel on edge label histograms. The kernel assumes edge-labeled graphs. Let G be a collection of graphs, and assume that each of their edges comes from an abstract edge space E. Given a set of node labels L, ℓ:E→L is a function that assigns labels to the edges of the graphs. Assume that there are d labels in total, that is d=|L|. Then, the edge label histogram of a graph G=(V,E) is a vector f=(f1,f2,…,fd), such that fi=|{(v,u)∈E:ℓ(v,u)=i}| for each i∈L. Let f,f′ be the edge label histograms of two graphs G,G′, respectively. \n",
